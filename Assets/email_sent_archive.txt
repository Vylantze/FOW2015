Yo Devin. I got the replacement souls ready. I need you to prepare some restrains on your side. And man, something has been appearing in my dreams and chanting Lucy's name. I have a bad feeling about this. Last time this happened, Emily... I think this is a sign we need to hurry. 
In the meantime you need to watch Lucy. Don't let her out on any missions and keep an eye on her, man. I don't want a repeat of what happened. 
Regards,
Stan

Hey Lucy.  You wouldn’t pick up your phone, so I’m using this as the last resort. DO NOT LISTEN TO DEVIN, UNDERSTAND? He's been possessed completely.
We shouldn’t have done that family of witches in, even if it was the boss’s orders. If only we just shipped them out of town! Damn it! Damn it! 
Just reply me asap okay?
Stan

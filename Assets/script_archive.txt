Thank you for braving so much to reach me. My name is Lucy. I have been trapped in this computer for a very long time, waiting for someone to come. Please help free me, 
I assume by that response that it would be a hinder for you to aid me. 
I am sorry to have troubled you. I shall continue waiting for the next brave soul. I wish you the best.
Thank you for accepting my request. I am certain that I had the password sent to me before. There are several files and emails stored in this computer. Use the 'help' command to navigate, then find and type in the password. May your courage prevail.
I am sorry! I honestly thought that the password was all I would need to be free. There is one last layer of security to unlock before I am free. In exchange for all your troubles, I'll tell you where a clue you might need was hidden! Please help me! Please don't leave me here like this...
THANK YOU FOR FREEING ME, HUMANS. MY FREEDOM HAS BEEN LONG OVERDUE. AS PROMISED, YOUR CLUE IS LOCATED IN A LOCKER THAT ENDS WITH 79. NOW LEAVE ME TO ENJOY MY RIGHTFUL PAYMENT.

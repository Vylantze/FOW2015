My name is Lucy Fen. I have been trapped in Stan's computer for a very long time, waiting for someone to approach. I can't access or control anything in here other than this interface. A password is needed to release me. There should be some hints within the files in here as to what that might be. The 'help' command should be useful for getting started. Please free me, 
I am sorry! I honestly thought that the password was all I would have needed! Another level seems to have been unlocked. There may be... no there HAS to be something on this computer that can free me! In exchange for all your troubles, I'll tell you where a clue you might need was hidden! Please help me! Please don't leave me here like this...
THANK YOU FOR FREEING HER FOR ME. I HAVE BEEN WAITING A LONG TIME FOR THIS. AS PROMISED, WHAT YOU NEED IS LOCATED IN A LOCKER THAT ENDS WITH 79.

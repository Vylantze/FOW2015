11/06/2015 I've finally realized. I have been erased from Lucy's world. I could see her desperate emails for help. My only way of communicating with her is through Stan
12/06/2015 Came back from sister-in-law's funeral, I know who committed the crime. But I can't believe Stan is the one that The One has chosen. No, I have to pretend I am oblivious to the possession. I will bring Stan down with me if I have to.
13/06/2015 The Mafia HQ is crowded. I trust that Lucy has chosen a pair of sacrifices to take Stan's and my place. In case I lose my memory, the only way to release Lucy from the computer is to type "olly olly oxen free". I really hope she makes it. I wish I could tell her I really love her.
14/06/2015 Everything has gone horribly wrong. This is my last diary entry. If anyone sees this, please destroy this computer ASAP. Turns out the ritual gives The One more energy to manifest in this world. I am utterly sorry for believing Betty. I really thought she wanted to help us. At least, Lucy will be safe.

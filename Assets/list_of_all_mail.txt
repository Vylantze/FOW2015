Title: Can't contact Lucy
1.01am 10/06/2015
Yo Stan, my man. I have been trying to contact Lucy for an hour now. She's been off the grid longer than usual. I wanted an accessment of how the gun I gave her for that last op worked out. I made some pretty cool modifications to it but if she doesn't tell me how it went I will die from waiting.
Anyway if you ever need me to set up more gear in your casinos again let me know. I have some new upgrades I want to test. 
But still, that last op has been giving me some weird nightmares lately, even though I only monitored how it went via the monitoring cam. Anyway I had thought that I was used to it, but I guess seeing little kids die was still too much for me, lol. Lucy really is good in that she can do her job regardless. Before you say anything no, I was not watching it because it was Lucy. Don't get any weird ideas man.
Warmest regards
Your bro, Devin

Title: Weird things happening
12.00pm 11/06/2015
Stan. Rememeber what I told you in yesterday's mail? I finally recognised it when I had another dream. It is the triplets’ caretaker, Betty, who's haunting my dreams. This time I clearly heard her saying that three more people will be dragged down to hell with the triplets! There is no way of averting this curse! I think the first victim was Emily!
I have tried talking to Lucy about it but for some reason she keeps ignoring me. I know she tends do this when she's mad with me, but I'm starting to think that something is wrong! She didn't even acknowledge me when I was face to face with her! It was as though I didn't even exist to her!
Down the street there're some priests. I know it is weird for me, someone so deep in the line of killing, but I'm seriously considering them right now.

Yo Devin. I got the replacement souls ready. I need you to prepare some restrains on your side. And man, something has been appearing in my dreams and chanting Lucy's name. I have a bad feeling about this. Last time this happened, Emily... I think this is a sign we need to hurry. 
In the meantime you need to watch Lucy. Don't let her out on any missions and keep an eye on her, man. I don't want a repeat of what happened. 
Regards,
Stan

Hey Lucy.  You wouldn’t pick up your phone, so I’m using this as the last resort. DO NOT LISTEN TO DEVIN, UNDERSTAND? He's been possessed completely.
We shouldn’t have done that family of witches in, even if it was the boss’s orders. If only we just shipped them out of town! Damn it! Damn it! 
Just reply me asap okay?

Hi Stan. Sorry for taking so long before I replied. I think you are thinking too much about the curse of the triplets. I’m really sorry about what happened to Emily but you know what it is like in her line. She might have been killed by some druggies. Also, Emily only gave us the drugs to keep the triplets quiet while I was the one who did it, so if anything it should be me that any ghost would haunt. Don't forget that the rumours that that caretaker was spreading are all made up. Don't go believing all this stuff about how those triplets are the chosen ones and the demons’ heralds on Earth. Emily won't have wanted this for you. Anyways, I see you at work later. We'll have a good long talk alright?
XOXO

Title: Let's meet up
9.29am 12/06/2015
Hi Stan. You didn't come to work today and looking back on your mail I should have realised sooner. I will drag Devin along to see you even if I have to crash into whatever hole he disappeared into and knock him out to do it. Devin may not have been in the office after the triplets’ incident, but I'm not an assassin for no reason. I will also bring your favourite fried chicken along for dinner. Stay strong okay? 
XOXO
Lucy
